Title：<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2024.116882">Creating ionic current pathways: A non-implantation approach to achieving cortical electrical signals for brain-computer interface</a>

doi: 10.1016/j.bios.2024.116882

This study introduces a novel method for acquiring brain electrical signals comparable to intracranial recordings without the health risks associated with implanted electrodes. We developed a technique using ultrasonic tools to create micro-holes in the skull and insert hollow implants, preventing natural healing. This approach establishes an artificial ionic current path (AICP) using tissue fluid, facilitating signal transmission from the cortex to the scalp surface. Experiments were conducted on pigs to validate the method's effectiveness. We synchronized our recordings with perforated electrocorticography (ECoG) for comparison. The AICP method yielded signal quality comparable to implanted ECoG in the low-frequency range, with a significant improvement in signal-to-noise ratio for evoked potentials. Our results demonstrate that this non-invasive technique can acquire high-quality brain signals, offering potential applications in neurophysiology, clinical research, and brain-computer interfaces. This innovative approach of utilizing tissue fluid as a natural conduction path opens new avenues for brain signal acquisition and analysis.
