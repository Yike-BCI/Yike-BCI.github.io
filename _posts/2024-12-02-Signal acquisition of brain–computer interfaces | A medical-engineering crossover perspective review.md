Title：<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fmre.2024.04.011">Signal acquisition of brain–computer interfaces: A medical-engineering crossover perspective review</a>

doi: 10.1016/j.fmre.2024.04.011

Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology represents a burgeoning interdisciplinary domain that facilitates direct communication between individuals and external devices. The efficacy of BCI systems is largely contingent upon the progress in signal acquisition methodologies. This paper endeavors to provide an exhaustive synopsis of signal acquisition technologies within the realm of BCI by scrutinizing research publications from the last ten years. Our review synthesizes insights from both clinical and engineering viewpoints, delineating a comprehensive two-dimensional framework for understanding signal acquisition in BCIs. We delineate nine discrete categories of technologies, furnishing exemplars for each and delineating the salient challenges pertinent to these modalities. This review furnishes researchers and practitioners with a broad-spectrum comprehension of the signal acquisition landscape in BCI, and deliberates on the paramount issues presently confronting the field. Prospective enhancements in BCI signal acquisition should focus on harmonizing a multitude of disciplinary perspectives. Achieving equilibrium between signal fidelity, invasiveness, biocompatibility, and other pivotal considerations is imperative. By doing so, we can propel BCI technology forward, bolstering its effectiveness, safety, and dependability, thereby contributing to an auspicious future for human-technology integration.
